# Polish Voivodeship Guessing Game ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

This is a simple Python game where the player tries to guess all 16 voivodeships (provinces) of Poland. The game uses a background map and `turtle` graphics to display correct guesses directly on the map.

## ðŸŽ® How it works

- A blank map of Poland is shown.
- The user has to guess voivodeship names (in lowercase, without Polish characters).
- Correct guesses appear at the correct location on the map.
- The game ends when:
  - All 16 voivodeships are guessed
  - or the user types `exit`
  - or after **5 minutes** pass (hidden timer)
